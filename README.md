•	Problem Statement
o	Provide a Film or a Movie Recommendation System/Engine

•	Expected results

	Popularity based
	Content based
	Collaborative filtering (if the dataset allows me to use this)

•	Why this question is important
o	The rapid growth of data collection has led to a new era of information. Data is being used to create more efficient systems and this is where Recommendation Systems come into play. Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are related to the search history of the user.
They are used to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. Moreover, companies like Netflix and Amazon depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and success.
